# Jam Statz

## Purpose

This is an idea for a website that will track a band's performances and albums. You will be able to track the shows you have been to and it will give you a statistcal overview of your live show attendance.

Some staticts include, the amount of shows you have seen of a certain band, the venues you have been to, the amount of times you have seen a song preformed live, the total amount of hours spent at shows, etc...

This project is actively being worked on and is not yet fully built out. Right now the jam-statz is being written in vite and utilizing AWS amplify.
